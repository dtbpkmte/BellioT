## What is it?
An IoT Door Bell that enables indoor people to see and talk easily with outdoor guests.

## Why do I need it?
In my house, my room is quite high from the ground. So whenever a guest presses my house's bell, I have to go to the first floor to ask who that is. That's very inconvenient. Of course I can just shout out from upstairs, but that is not very nice. So this device may make my life easier.

## What are the features?
The bell is connected to a master device via Wifi, and the two devices behave like two telephones. I can talk easily to the guest (and may even see his/her face with a camera --- hopefully, not done yet). I am also thinking about extending it so that I can use a mobile app to communicate with my guest when I'm not at home.
